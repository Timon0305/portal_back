Metronic Angular

I want to be able to to authenticate against credentials in 
mysql database securely(https://academind.com/learn/react/connect-to-database/).

So i need to setup a backend API and connect with metronic
(https://keenthemes.com/metronic/?page=docs&section=angular-mock-backend)

To show that in works just show the data of the authenticated user in dashboard.

Table users:

username: user
password: resu
data: user-data

username: user2
password: resu2
data: user2-data

I also need to upload and download files on the server. I dont see this in the angular demo.

It would help if you create an example in My-page demo page. 
A field for upload file and field to download file.
